    <h1>Whales</h1>
    <p><strong>By:</strong> Vi (5/6J)</p>

    <p>Whales are the biggest animals in the world. They live in the ocean and they are mammals, which means they have babies and breathe air.</p>

    <p>There are different kinds of whales. My favourite is the blue whale.</p>

    <p>Whales talk to each other with songs and sounds. Some people say it's like music.</p>

    <p>We need to protect whales from pollution.</p>

    <p>I hope to see a real whale one day!</p>
